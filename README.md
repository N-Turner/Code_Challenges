# Code_Challenges
A repo for different approaches to coding challenges to aid those learning to program or improving their skills.
Ideally use this as a resource when you are completely stuck. 

Remember to plan out your strategy and plan of attack before you write any code. Get some pseudocode down first. Read documentation.
If you can't solve a problem within 15-20 minutes look at a solution. Then go back and implement that solution completely from memory!
Don't skip that part. If you use someone else's solution, make sure you understand it before moving on. Play around with methods
you've never seen before. Look up their documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

Try to spend 70% of your time solving the problem and 30% writing the actual code.
Rememeber to have fun. These are toy problems, treat them that way. They exist simply for learning.

Never give up, but don't be afraid to fail. Growth mindset over perfection always wins. Play the long-term game.
